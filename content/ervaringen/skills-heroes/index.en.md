In 2022, my teacher Tamme Kuipers asked me if I wanted to participate in the [ICT administrator](https://worldskillsnetherlands.nl/wedstrijd/skillsheroes/ict-beheerder/) competition of [Skills Heroes](https://worldskillsnetherlands.nl/skillsheroes/watisskillsheroes/).

### What is Skills Heroes?
Skills Heroes are vocational competitions for vocational education, with around 50 subjects participating in the competitions.

### Qualification
The qualification competition for ICT administrators was held in Leiden. There were 24 participants in this competition, and I was among the first 8 candidates, which means I qualified for the finals.

### The finals
Skills the Finals will take place on March 23rd and 24th, and I will compete against the other 7 students who made it to the finals. This event will take place at the RAI Amsterdam.
