In 2022, my teacher Tamme Kuipers asked me if I wanted to participate in the [ICT Beheerder]() competition of [Skills Heroes]().

### What is Skills Heroes?

Skills Heroes are vocational competitions for secondary vocational education, in which approximately 50 different vocations are represented.

### Qualification

The qualification competition for the ICT administrators took place in Leiden. 24 participants took part in this competition, and I was one of the first 8 candidates, which means that I qualified for the final.

### Skills the Finals

Skills the Finals took place in Amsterdam on March 23 and 24, 2023. In the final, I competed against the rest of the students who had made it to the final. Ultimately, I came in seventh place in the Netherlands.
