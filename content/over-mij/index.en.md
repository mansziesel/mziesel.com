My name is Mans, I am 17 years old and I am a motivated IT student.

Currently, I am in the final year of the *Expert IT systems and devices* program at ROC van Twente. During my education, I have built a strong foundation in a wide range of IT-related fields, such as programming, networking, system administration, and cyber security. In addition to my education, I have completed various internships and practical projects where I have been able to apply my knowledge in practice and further develop my skills. To learn more about my experience, please visit the experience page.

At the moment, I am actively working at [Microcenter](https://microcenter.nl) in Almelo as an employee. At Microcenter, I am responsible for maintaining, improving, and developing new environments/websites. This internship has given me the opportunity to refine my skills and learn about the business in the ICT sector.

In the future, I plan to complete an ICT-related program at the HBO level. I am confident that my skills and experience make me a strong candidate for entry-level positions in the IT field, and I am motivated to continue learning and growing as a professional.

Thank you for visiting my website. If you have any questions or would like to learn more about my skills and experience, please feel free to contact me.
