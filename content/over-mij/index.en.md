My name is Mans, I am 17 years old, and I am a motivated IT student.

Currently, I am in the final year of my *Expert IT systems and devices* course at ROC van Twente. During my education, I have built a strong foundation in a wide range of IT-related fields, such as programming, networking, system administration, and cybersecurity. In addition to my education, I have completed various internships and practical projects where I have been able to apply my knowledge in practice and further develop my skills. To learn more about my experience, please visit the experience page.

At the moment, I am actively working at [Microcenter automatisering](https://microcenter.nl/) in Almelo as a member of the technical department. At Microcenter, I am involved in maintaining, improving, and developing new environments/websites. Working at Microcenter has given me the opportunity to refine my skills and learn about the business world in the ICT sector.

In the future, I plan to complete an ICT-related course at the HBO level. 

Thank you for visiting my website. If you have any questions or would like to learn more about my skills and experience, please feel free to contact me.
